The provided code is a basic implementation of a web server using Winsock in C++. It creates a socket, binds
it to a specified address (IP and port), and listens for incoming client connections. Upon accepting a client
request, it reads the request and performs a sorting operation using the merge sort algorithm on a predefined set of numbers. 
The sorted numbers, along with the original input numbers, are then formatted into an HTML response and sent back to the client.
The HTML response includes a title, a header displaying the sorted numbers, and an unordered list showing both the input and sorted numbers.
The server continues to listen for new client requests in an infinite loop until it is terminated.
